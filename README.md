Basic Sudoku solvers.

A common problem whenever starting to learn a new language is that it's a pain to come up with something to do.

So this is my "Doug implements the same thing in many different languages"

It's actually kind of a nice problem to solve as it involves a bunch of base programming concepts
that are very useful to know in each language:
- basic maths (floor)
- basic OO (grid)
- maps/dictionaries/arrays (based on the language)
- byref in the relevant languages
- recursion
- loops
- control flow (if's :P)
- file io
- argv

## Potential languages to still do:

~- Ruby~
- C
- C#
- LUA
- Kotlin
- Java (lol)
- Swift
- Something in Lisp maybe?
- C++?
- Fortran
- Cobol
- Pure BASH maybe?
- ZIG
- Elixir
- Lisp of some kind (hahaha probably not)
